"""
AsyncQualifier plugin Discord commands.

This module provides async qualifier-related Discord commands (cogs).
Currently, async qualifier commands are still in the core discordbot directory.

For now, this provides a placeholder for future command organization.
"""

# Commands are still in discordbot/commands/async_qualifier.py
# They will be migrated here in a future phase
