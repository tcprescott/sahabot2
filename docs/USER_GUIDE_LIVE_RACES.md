## Overview

**Live Races** are scheduled racing events that take place in real-time on RaceTime.gg. Unlike standard async races where you submit results at your convenience, live races require all participants to race together at a scheduled time.

### Key Features
- Scheduled at specific times for your tournament pool
- Hosted on RaceTime.gg with real-time racing
- Automatic room creation 15 minutes before start time
- Discord notifications for all race events
- Real-time race tracking and status updates

### Who Can Participate?
Live races are typically open to all active participants in a tournament pool. Your eligibility depends on:
- Being an active participant in the tournament
- Being in the correct pool (if the race is pool-specific)
- Meeting any tournament-specific requirements

Check the **Live Races** tab in your tournament. If you see a race listed and it's for your pool, you're eligible.

### What if I can't make the scheduled time?
Contact tournament organizers. They may be able to reschedule or create an alternate race time. Live races require real-time participation, so attendance is mandatory.

### When should I join the RaceTime.gg room?
Join as soon as the room opens (15 minutes before start time). This ensures you're ready when the race begins.

You'll receive a notification with the cancellation reason. No action is needed. Organizers may reschedule if appropriate.

Yes, you must have a RaceTime.gg account linked to your tournament profile. Check your profile settings to link your account.

### What if I miss the race start?
You may still be able to join if the race room is still open, but you'll start behind other participants. Contact organizers if you have technical issues.

### How are results tracked?
Results are automatically tracked from RaceTime.gg. You don't need to manually submit your time.

### Can I practice the seed before the race?
Check your tournament rules. Some tournaments allow practice, others require blind races.
